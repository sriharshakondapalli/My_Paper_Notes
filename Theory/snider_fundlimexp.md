# [Fundamental limits of energy dissipation in charge-based computing](https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.3484959) - 2010

### My Notes
This paper shows that it is indeed possible to charge a capacitor to above KT energy with no lower limit on the dissipation energy (resistor or wire).
So this proves that it is indeed possible to charge a capacitor to desired energy state (grater than KT) while dissipating sub KT energy throught the resistor.

The key component of the paper is the system implementation. They used simple RC element with insrumentation amplifier on the output that can switch between R and C to measure voltages with low input capacitance.

### My Notes
Energy dissipation for copy, read and write operations are performed. 
Key statement -  Accounting for thermal ﬂuctuations is important in measuring small signals in a thermal environment, but thermal ﬂuctuations do not alter the basic energetics of computation, and do not necessarily produce bit errors.
