# [Information erasure without an energy cost](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rspa.2010.0577)

### Key Points

### Conclusion
-  For example, our results do not appear contentious at all for an analogous, but broader, statement of the second law as: It is impossible to derive mechanical effect from any portion of matter through a reduction in the information-theoretic entropy of the system as a whole.

### My Points

Considering angular momentum reservoirs as the fundamental information unit, the CNOT gate has a fundamental limitation saying delE > 0 but not necessarily < KTln2
