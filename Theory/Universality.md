### My Notes
The distribution of bus arrival times typically take poisson distribution. But scheduled buses take a univerasal distribution that is similar to that of prime gaps.
Riemann zeta function zeros also take the same distribution. Also the exclusion region around the cones in the chicken eye take similar distribution.
Number of visits in social network take similar distribution (large network). Spacing between the energy levels in heavy nucleus atoms take the same distribution.
Thus exhibiting the univerality principle across the domains of math, physics, biology and social networks.

### Prime Numbers

This is a beautiful demonstration about the patterns you observe in prime numbers in a 2D plane.
Nothing to do with distribution of prime numbers or gaps between prime numbers but takes the property of symmetry and periodicity and shows patterns in polar coordiantes.

This work seems to find similarities between the knots in topological geometry objects and the number of primes and indeed they conculde showing simular statistics.
