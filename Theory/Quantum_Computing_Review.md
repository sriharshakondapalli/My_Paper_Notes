# [A quantum engineer’s guide to superconducting qubits][1]

## Key Points

- The aim of this review is to provide quantum engineers with an introductory guide to the central concepts and challenges in the rapidly accelerating field of superconducting quantum circuits.
- Here, we review several foundational elements—qubit design, noise properties, qubit control, and readout techniques—developed during this period, bridging fundamental concepts in circuit quantum electrodynamics and contemporary, state-of-the-art applications in gate-model quantum computation.
- Quantum processors harness the intrinsic properties of quantum mechanical systems—such as quantum parallelism and quantum interference—to solve certain problems where classical computers fall short.
- The requirements imposed by larger quantum processors have shifted the mindset within the community, from solely scientific discovery to the development of new, foundational engineering abstractions associated with the design, control, and readout of multiqubit quantum systems. The result is the emergence of a new discipline termed “quantum engineering,” which serves to bridge basic sciences, mathematics, and computer science with fields generally associated with traditional engineering.
- One prominent platform for constructing a multiqubit quantum processor involves superconducting qubits, in which information is stored in quantum degrees of freedom (DOFs) of nanofabricated, anharmonic oscillators (AHOs) constructed from superconducting circuit elements. In contrast to other platforms, e.g., electron spins in silicon and quantum dots, trapped ions, ultracold atoms, nitrogen-vacancies in diamonds, and polarized photons, where the quantum information is encoded in natural microscopic quantum systems, superconducting qubits are macroscopic in size and lithographically defined.

### Section 3

## Conclusion

## My Notes

Section 2 primarily started with LC tand and showed an example of hamiltonian function. Later it took the same analogy to describe a flux and charge based hamiltonian and introduced the quantum aspect of the problem. 
In addition it also has some discussion about non linearity and system process driven by energy.
Some discussion on recent progress is Qu-bit sensitivity to flux noise is also described.
Mutual capacitance and mutual inductance as an indicator for entaglement.
