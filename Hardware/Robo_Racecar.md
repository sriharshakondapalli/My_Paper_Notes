### Key Points
- MuSHR is inspired by the MIT RACECAR project but can be built with a fraction of the cost, while not sacrificing autonomous navigation performance.
- Finally, MuSHR further reduces costs by using less expensive sensors, such as the YDLIDAR X4 which costs about sixteen times less than the MIT racecarâ€™s Hokuyo UST-10LX. We have found that the YDLIDAR X4s capabilities to be sufficient for typical localization tasks.
