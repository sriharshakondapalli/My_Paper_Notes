Biological learning curves outperform existing ones in artificial intelligence algorithms

Deep learning algorithms are distant from current knowledge of neuroscience. It has been shown that the generalization error for biological perceptrons decreases rapidly with increasing number of examples, independently of the size of the input using either synaptic learning, or solely through dendritic adaptation with a mechanism of swinging between reflecting boundaries (without learning steps). Simulations indicate the potency of neurobiological mechanisms, opening opportunities for developing a superior class of deep learning algorithms.
