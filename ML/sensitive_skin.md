- Researchers at National University of Singapore developed an electronic skin that transmits sensations of contact, pressure, and temperature from different parts of the membrane at once.
- How it works: Asynchronously Coded Electronic Skin (or ACES) comprises several types of sensors that are triggered by external events rather than internal queries. 

- ACES sensors share a range of bandwidth on a single wire. Most other e-skin prototypes send information serially, which can cause latency in a large array. 
- Each sensor processes events independently. This makes ACES more like the human nervous system, which can experience sitting in a chair, being pawed by a cat, and feeling oppressed by mid-summer humidity all at once. 
- The sensor array can be paired with different substrates depending on the application.
- ACES can take a licking. It continued to work even after the researchers cut it into a zagging ribbon.

- Smarter skin: The researchers trained neural nets to infer complex sensations by combining the inputs from several sensors over time.
- For instance, they instructed an e-skinned robot hand to grab an object, then tugged that object using a string.
- The network determined the object was slipping from its grasp based on the sequence of sensors reporting loss of pressure and concurrent signals from others reporting new contact.

- Why it matters: Terminators and Jedi amputees aren’t the only ones who could benefit from resilient e-skin.
- The sensor fabric could coat hazard suits, helping first responders monitor their surroundings as they pick through the rubble of a disaster. 
- Tactile feedback could enable warehouse robots to operate more safely with human co-workers. 
- Farm robots of the future will need to reach through branches while maintaining enough sensitivity to pick delicate fruit. 
- We’re thinking: Machine learning thrives on data, and ACES, which packs around 70 sensors into a square inch, could generate plenty. That may help dexterous robots learn to interact with the world in more nuanced ways.
