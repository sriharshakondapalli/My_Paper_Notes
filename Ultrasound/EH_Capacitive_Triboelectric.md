# [Transcutaneous ultrasound energy harvesting using capacitive triboelectric technology](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/365/6452/491.abstract)

### Key Points

- We use ultrasound to deliver mechanical energy through skin and liquids and demonstrate a thin implantable vibrating triboelectric generator able to effectively harvest it.
-The ultrasound can induce micrometer-scale displacement of a polymer thin membrane to generate electrical energy through contact electrification. 
- We recharge a lithium-ion battery at a rate of 166 microcoulombs per second in water. 
- The voltage and current generated ex vivo by ultrasound energy transfer reached 2.4 volts and 156 microamps under porcine tissue.

### My Notes

Eventhough this is a sience article there are no deatials about the energy harvester. 
It just says transformer followed by rectifier which is insufficient information for replication of the proposed work.
Impedence matching plays a major role but since its TEG it may not matter i guess but still discussion in terms of electrical parameters needs to be discussed.
