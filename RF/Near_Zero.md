### Key Points
- The Near Zero Power RF and Sensor Operations (N-ZERO) program has the goal of developing the technological foundation for persistent, event-driven sensing capabilities in which the sensor can remain dormant, with near-zero power consumption, until awakened by an external trigger or stimulus. 
- Examples of relevant stimuli are acoustic signatures of particular vehicle types or radio signatures of specific communications protocols. 
- If successful, the program could extend the lifetime of remotely deployed communications and environmental sensors—also known as unattended ground sensors (UGS)—from weeks or months to years.

- By advancing state-of-the-art sensing capabilities for national security through N-ZERO, DARPA could help make the Internet of Things more efficient and effective across countless scenarios and environments, thus transforming the way people live.
